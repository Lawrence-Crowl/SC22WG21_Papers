# This is an example implementation of the proposed basic_osyncstream from P0053 for C++17.

It might contain bugs and races but should work. Feedback welcome.

The last testcase fails deliberately to be able to view the output generated from several threads.

Best loaded into Cevelop (www.cevelop.com) for compilation and running the tests.
