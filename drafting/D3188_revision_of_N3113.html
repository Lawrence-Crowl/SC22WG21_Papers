    <h1>N3188 - Revision to N3113: Async Launch Policies (CH 36)</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>The limitation of async's launch strategies to only 2 different strategies (sync,
    async) and a third strategy saying either one makes it hard for vendors to provide
    better strategies in the future and for users writing portable code wrt to the
    available strategies.</p>

    <p>A bitmask type for the async launch strategy seems to be more suitable than a
    3-way enum. However, adaptation of the bitmask requirements (GB53) couldn't be voted
    in Rapperswil, but were close to and it is expected they will be voted in 
    Batavia. Further discussion provided insight that an enum with corresponding 
    overloaded bit-operators should be chosen.</p>

    <h2>Problem</h2>

    <p>Providing only three different possible values for the enum launch and saying that
    launch::any means either launch::sync or launch::async is very restricting. This
    hinders future implementors to provide clever infrastructures that can simply used
    by a call to async(launch::any,...). Also there is no hook for an implementation to
    provide additional alternatives to launch enumeration and no useful means to combine
    those (i.e. interpret them like flags). We believe something like async(launch::sync
    | launch::async, ...) should be allowed and can become especially useful if one could
    say also something like async(launch::any &amp; ~launch::sync, ....) respectively.
    This flexibility might limit the features usable in the function called through
    async(), but it will allow a path to effortless profit from improved
    hardware/software without complicating the programming model when just using
    async(launch::any,...)</p>
    
    <p>The visual distinction of <code>launch::sync</code> and <code>launch::async</code> 
    is hard to see. In addition <code>launch::sync</code> is not about synchronous execution,
    but deferring the function execution until its result is really wanted, which may never.
    Therefore this document suggests also renaming the launch policy
    <code>launch::sync</code>  to become 
    <code>launch::deferred</code> 
    </p>

    <h2>Discussion</h2>

    <p>CH 36 provided the following proposal:</p>

    <p>Change in 30.6.1 'enum class launch' to allow further implementation defined
    values and provide the following bit-operators on the launch values (operator|,
    operator&amp;, operator~ delivering a launch value). Note: a possible implementation
    might use an unsigned value to represent the launch enums, but we shouldn't limit the
    standard to just 32 or 64 available bits in that case and also should keep the launch
    enums in their own enum namespace.</p>

    <p>Change [future.async] p3 according to the changes to enum launch. change
    --launch::any to "the implementation may choose any of the policies it provides."
    Note: this can mean that an implementation may restrict the called function to take
    all required information by copy in case it will be called in a different address
    space, or even, on a different processor type. To ensure that a call is either
    performed like launch::async or launch::sync describe one should call
    async(launch::sync|launch::async,...)</p>

    <p>Discussion in Rapperswil:</p>

    <p>The discussion discovered that the launch enum served two aspects: On the one hand,
    there is an implementation view, where an "enum bit" can denote a specific async launch
    strategy, e.g., in a thread pool, or run it on a GPU. Such a specific launch
    mechanism provides specific requirements for the underlying function to be run
    asynchronously, such as copying all input values, or only referring to read-only data
    to avoid races. On the other hand, there is a user's view where the enum should specify
    the requirements the user
    can guarantee for the asynchronously called function and the implementation should be
    able to select an appropriate one, may be even dynamically for very clever
    implementations (see below).</p>

    <p>To allow this dual nature the enum should provide a hook for implementers to
    extend it and for users to combine enum values in a useful way, e.g., with a meaning
    "anything but sync", or "I don't care, because the function is a pure function and
    would not give any data races or undefined behavior".</p>

    <p>The discussion also covered if launch::any is a good name for
    (launch::sync|launch::async) or for "everything implementers think is safe". However,
    the name "default" is a keyword and thus unavailable. Nevertheless, the "default"
    used by the async() function overload without a launch strategy should at least be
    (launch::sync|launch::async).</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Minutes from Discussion in Rapperswil:</p>
    <pre>
existing launch enums: sync, async
    
vendor and future lunch enums: separate_process, other_endian, gpu

possible launch enum sets:
   nothing_outside_standard = async | sync
   no_restrictions_beyond_the_standard = 
   what_implementers_think_is_safe =
   everything_implementers_have = 
    
launch::default &lt;= launch::no_restrictions_beyond_the_standard
   
launch::any = ?
   
std::async( task );
   
std::async( std::launch::async | std::launch::gpu, task );
</pre>

    <p>Proposed text: The value launch::default is at least sync|async. Any vendor
    extensions shall place no additional restrictions on task interaction.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>further discussion on the reflector and emails provided input and changes.</p>

<p>Discussion in Batavia and on reflector while there</p>

<p>Daniel Kr&uuml;gler</p>
<p>I would strongly appreciate, if this paper would follow the
idea that was implemented in the bitmask-repair paper
</p><p>
http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2010/n3110.html
</p><p>
that is now in the staging area and to *remove* the declared
operators for type launch, because they are implied by the
bitmask definition enforced by this bimask paper. The disadvantage
of the current paper state is that the non-mutable functions are
unnecessarily non-constexpr, and second we have unnecessary
wording duplication with chances of unwanted differences.
</p><p>
IMO the chances of a rejection of n3110 are minimal, because
it was only rejected the last time to get more time to read it.
</p>
</em>
<p>The previous version of this paper N3113 caused several minor conflicting edits
with other papers or issues that were corrected here: </p>
<ul><li>N3125 - change "happens-before" to "synchronizes-with" because happens-before doesn't 
guarantee transitivity in 30.6.9p5</li>
<li>N3129 - Lawrence paper on clarifying handling of liason state 
(aka associated asynchronous state): add the paper's number</li>
<li>N3170 - conflicting edits in 30.6.9 p5 wrt. to "as if joining a thread">
make the proposed change to the corresponding sentence</li>
<li>LWG 1518 - conflicting edits in 30.6.9 p3 wrt to semantics of when a deferred function 
gets called (not in the case of timed waiting functions)</li>
</ul>
<p>Plus it got rid of the bitmask operators, because those are implied, 
when the non-controversial paper N3110 is voted in.</p>

    <h2>Proposed Changes</h2>

    <h3>Make launch a bitmask type according to N3110:</h3>


    <p>In 30.6.1 p1 replace</p>
<del>
    <pre>
enum class launch {
 any,   
 async,
 sync
};
</pre>
</del>
    <p>with</p>
<ins>
    <pre>
enum class launch : <em>unspecified</em> {
  async = <em>unspecified</em>,
  deferred = <em>unspecified</em>
  <em>, implementation defined</em>
};

</pre>
</ins>

    <p>At the end of 30.6.1 add</p>
<ins>
    <p>The enum type launch is an implementation-defined bitmask type
    (17.5.2.1.3) with launch::async and launch::deferred denoting individual bits. 
    [ <em>Note</em>: 
    Implementations can provide bitmasks to specify restrictions on task interaction
    by functions launched by <code>async()</code> applicable to a corresponding subset 
    of available launch policies.
    Implementations that would like to extend the behavior of the first
    overload of async are free to do so by adding their extensions to the launch
    policy under the "as if" rule.
    <em>end note</em> ]</p>
</ins>

	<p>Change 30.6.4 paragraph 2 as follows:</p>
	
	[<em>Note</em>: The result can be any kind of object including a function to
	compute that result, as used by <code>async</code> when <code>policy</code> is 
	<code>launch::<ins>deferred</ins><del>sync</del></code>. &mdash;
	<em>end note</em> ]

    <h3>Specify semantics in a clearer way using terminology from 1.10 and an updated
    30.4 (according to the paper by Lawrence Crowl)</h3>

    <p>Change 30.6.9 p3 as follows:</p>
    <p>
	<em>Effects:</em> The first function behaves the same as a call to the second
	function with a <code>policy</code> argument of <code><del>launch::any</del>
	<ins>(launch::async|launch::deferred)</ins></code>
	and the same arguments
	for <code>F</code> and <code>Args</code>. 
	The second function creates an associated asynchronous
	state that is associated with the returned <code>future</code> object. The further
	behavior of the second function depends on the <code>policy</code> argument as
	follows. 
	<ins>If more than one bullet applies, the implementation may choose any applicable policy.</ins>
	</p>
	
	<p>&mdash; <ins>If</ins> <code> launch::async</code> <ins>is set in <code>policy</code></ins>
	&mdash; executes <code><em>INVOKE</em>(decay_copy(std::forward&lt;F&gt;(f)),
	decay_copy(std::forward&lt;Args&gt;(args))...)</code> (20.8.2, 30.3.1.2) as if in
	a new thread of execution represented by a <code>thread</code> object with the
	calls to <code>decay_copy()</code> being evaluated in the thread that called
	<code>async</code>. Any return value is stored as the result in the associated
	asynchronous state. Any exception propagated from the execution of
	<code><em>INVOKE</em>(decay_copy(std::forward&lt;F&gt;(f)),
	decay_copy(std::forward&lt;Args&gt;(args))...)</code> is stored as the
	exceptional result in the associated asynchronous state. The
	<code>thread</code> object is stored in the associated asynchronous state and
	affects the behavior of any <del><code>future</code></del><ins>asynchronous return</ins>
	objects that reference that state.
	</p>
	
	
    <p>&mdash;<ins>If</ins> <code>launch::<del>sync</del><ins>deferred</ins></code>
    <ins> is set in <code>policy</code></ins>
     &mdash; Stores
    <code>decay_copy(std::forward&lt;F&gt;(f))</code> and
    <code>decay_copy(std::forward&lt;Arg&gt;(args))...</code> in the associated
    asynchronous state. These copies of <code>f</code> and <code>args</code> constitute a
    <em>deferred function</em>. Invocation of the deferred function evaluates
    <code>INVOKE(g, xyz)</code> where <code>g</code> is the stored value of
    <code>decay_copy(std::forward&lt;F&gt;(f))</code> and <code>xyz</code> is the stored
    copy of <code>decay_copy(std::forward&lt;Args.(args))...</code>. The associated
    asynchronous state is not <ins>made</ins> ready until the function has completed.

    <ins>[ <em>Note:</em> If this policy is specified together with other policies,
    such as when using a <code>policy</code> value of <code>launch::async|launch::deferred</code>,

    <p><del>&mdash;<code>launc::any </code> &mdash; the implementation

    <p>Change 30.6.9 p5 as follows:</p>

    <p><em>Synchronization</em>: <ins>Regardless of provided <code>policy</code></ins></p>

    <ul>
      <li>the invocation of <code>async</code> 
      <del>happens before</del><ins>synchronizes with</ins> (1.10) the invocation of

<ins>
      <li>the completion of the function <code>f</code> is sequenced before

    <p>If <ins><code>launch::async</code> is set in policy</ins> 
    <del>the invocation is not deferred,</del></p>

    <ul>
      <li>a call to a waiting function on an asynchronous return object that shares the
      associated asynchronous state created by this <code>async</code> call shall block
      until the associated <code>thread</code> has completed
      <ins>, as if joined ([thread.thread.member])</ins>.</li>

    </ul>

    <p>Change the note in 30.6.9 p 9 as follows:</p>

    <p>[ <em>Note</em>: line #1 might not result in concurrency because the

    use <code>launch::<ins>deferred</ins><del>sync</del></code>, in which case the lambda might
    not be invoked until the <code>get()</code> call; in that case, <code>work1</code>
