\chapter{History}
\section{integer_sequence}
N3658 and its predecessor N3493 introduced \tcode{integer_sequence} facility and provide application of this features, for example \tcode{apply()} that is proposed in this paper.
\section{Observations}
There is a lot of history I am unaware of and several implementations posted on StackOverflow. Also the C++14 CD contains an implementation of \tcode{apply()} as an example of \tcode{std::integer_sequence} in [intseq.general].
\section{Using tuplevar... or operator...}
Mike Spertus made me aware of the proposed language extension to form a parameter pack from a tuple, i.e., by overloading an \tcode{operator...} which might make the provision of \tcode{apply()} moot. However, up to now, no such feature has been proposed to the standard committee and it is unclear if it would make it into C++17. Even if it would, it would just make the implementation of apply trivial.
\chapter{Introduction}
Tuples are great for generic programming with variadic templates. However, the standard does not define a general purpose facility that allows to call a function/functor/lambda with the tuple elements as arguments. Such a feature should be provided, because it is useful (at least for me). It even is given as an example of \tcode{std::integer_sequence} in [intseq.general] coming from N3658. 
\section{Rationale}
It is easy to create tuples from variadic templates either from types directly as \tcode{std::tuple<PACK...>} or  with \tcode{std::make_tuple()} or \tcode{std::forward_as_tuple()} the opposite mechanism of passing a tuple's elements as function arguments is not available.

Some suggested to not use the name \tcode{apply() }and reserve that to a mechanism like \emph{\tcode{INVOKE}} in the standard library and use \tcode{apply_from_tuple()} instead.

\section{Open Issues to be Discussed}
It is open, if \tcode{apply()} should get a \tcode{noexcept(noexcept(xxx))} specification delegating to the underlying effect. Advice from library working group is requested.

Should \tcode{apply()} be \tcode{constexpr} to make it applicable in meta programming or concepts?

\chapter{Possible Implementation}
The following implementation suggestion was derived from N3658, N3690, and StackOverflow (http://stackoverflow.com/a/12650100) and some simplification. It actually seems to work with current \tcode{clang -std=c++1y}.

\begin{codeblock}
template<typename F, typename Tuple, size_t ... I>
decltype(auto) apply_impl(F&& f, Tuple&& t, index_sequence<I...>) {
	return forward<F>(f)(get<I>(forward<Tuple>(t))...);
}
template<typename F, typename Tuple>
decltype(auto) apply(F&& f, Tuple&& t) {
  using Indices = make_index_sequence<tuple_size<decay_t<Tuple>>::value>;
  return apply_impl(forward<F>(f), forward<Tuple>(t), Indices{});
}
\end{codeblock}

\chapter{Proposed Library Additions}

Add the following declaration in [tuple.general] in the synopsis under the group \emph{element access}:

\begin{codeblock}
template<typename F, typename Tuple, size_t ... I>
decltype(auto) apply_impl(F&& f, Tuple&& t, index_sequence<I...>) // exposition only
{
	return forward<F>(f)(get<I>(forward<Tuple>(t))...); // exposition only
}

template <typename F, typename Tuple>
decltype(auto) apply(F&& f, Tuple&& args);
\end{codeblock}

Append the following to section [tuple.elem] after paragraph 11.

\begin{itemdecl}
template <typename F, typename Tuple>
decltype(auto) apply(F&& f, Tuple&& args);
\end{itemdecl}
\begin{itemdescr}
\pnum
\requires \tcode{args} provides tuple-like access. \tcode{f} is a function object.

\effects Equivalent to \tcode{return apply_impl(forward<F>(f), forward<Tuple>(t),
 make_index_sequence<tuple_size<std::decay_t<Tuple>>::value>\{\});}
\end{itemdescr}
